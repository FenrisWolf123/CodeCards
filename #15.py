"""
Given an array containing n positive integers,
a subset of this array is called Bitonic if it is first increasing, then decreasing.
Given this array with random numbers,
Which is the longest Bitonic sequence that can be made?

NOTE:
    - you may not exchange the postion of numbers.
      if 2 came before 10 then even in the answer 2 will be before 10
      therefore you may only delete to make the sequence
    - A sequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic with the decreasing part as empty.
      Similarly, decreasing order sequence is considered Bitonic with the increasing part as empty.
